Do not make any major changes mid-season! As a high school athlete, it is important to slowly incorporate changes, such as diet, to you routine especially if you are trying to add weight. The biggest benefit for you will be increasing your protein and potentially fat intake over time. Protein will be crucial while increasing resistance exercise and building the strength to better endure higher mileage and intensities (mainly started in the off-season). Healthy fats will aid in the weight gain and allow your body additional sources of energy if need be with the longer workouts. Carb intake should remain high as well - a good way to keep this high is incorporating more fruits and vegetables into your diet."

A lot can be done with diet. The first thing we want to normalize is your protein intake. Eat breakfast if you are hungry. You could have a Greek yogurt with some fruits and nuts. At lunch aim for a big salad with a protein portion the size of your hand. You can add bread if you are exercising more during the day. For snacks think about adding more proteins too: Greek yogurt, jerky, nuts, Rise bar. For better recovery also think about adding more proteins with a fruit for example. If you are exercising more than 90 min, you will need to start eating during your run. Think about small bites of food, Clif bloks are a good choice or you could have bites of bars every 15-20 minutes. Sports nutrition drinks also work as long as it is not too hot.

In the evening instead of snacking on cookies, have a glass of soy milk or almond milk with some protein powder too to help with satiety. 
Add back more carbohydrates to your lunch and dinner when you are exercising more during the day.
Since you don't get a lot of dairy, look for milks that are fortified in calcium. Green leafy veggies, brocoli, tofu, almonds, seeds are also rich in calcium. 
You are also taking a 2000iu vitamin D supplements. Think about getting re-tested to see where you are since this is a higher dose.

Vitamin B12 should get re-tested too. You can alternate days where you take a vitamin and when you are not. Meats, fish and eggs are rich in vitamin B12 so you should have already plenty from your diet."

I do agree with your previous dietitians in the sense that the body typically has a set weight that it likes to hover around. It sounded like you are active and eat fairly healthy, and your downfalls were eating too much at once (you had mentioned eating a whole bag of nuts at once). 

With weight loss goals in combination with your increasing age and the wight that your body has settled at, small changes to your diet will reap minor changes towards your goals. If you want to see a more drastic change while still being safe and staying healthy, you have to tighten up the laces on your diet and avoid excessive eating (beyond what you need to perform and stay healthy). The best way to do this is to test your resting metabolic rate and get an idea of what your body needs. Without this, you may currently be restricting below what your needs are and that may then, not only encourage slowing of your metabolism, but may also encourage fat storage."

You will have better blood sugar control that way and perhaps this will normalize your apetite. You should still listen to your appetite and aim to be at 8/10 after a meal, no more.

 As we discussed, for your goal of bone health, it sounds like you are taking the right supplements (those that your doctor prescribed), to help you maintain your bone density as best you can. By the end of the week I will email you a few exercises that may help slow the progression of bone loss as well as a few balance exercises and core exercises, as these seemed to be of interest to you. Also, below is a list of food sources of some of the nutrients that you were interested in.

CoQ10: walnuts, peanuts, soybeans, spinach, azuki beans, wheat germ and whole grains. A 1/2-cup serving of boiled, chopped broccoli contains 0.5 milligrams. Eating these foods raw (if you can do so without stomach irritation) provides the greatest amounts of coenzyme Q10, as heating changes the qualities of the enzyme.

Omega 3 FA: You seem to be getting a good amount of this from the fish that you are eating. Ground, refrigerated flaxseeds can also help you get the Omega 3 FAs that you need!"

1.	Environment- Keep the areas that you are in the most (work, home), clear of refined, processed foods  (out of sight, out of mind) while surrounding yourself with the foods that you need and that are healthy.
2.	Every meal doesnt have to be a process or event. Many cultures and relationships center around food, but not every meal needs to. Sometimes you just need to eat to fuel the machine.

-As you mentioned turmeric (I will email you a few recipes for this by the end of the week)
-Cold water fish (I believe that you stated that you get plenty of Omega-3s).
-Virgin olive oil (not used on high heat cooking, but drizzled on foods).
-Green tea has also been shown to have an anti-inflammatory response by the body. 
-Green leafy vegetables, vegetables in general, and a variety of fruits may help with inflammation.

Foods that may cause inflammation: 
- An imbalance of Omega-6 and Omega-3 (too much Omega-6 may cause inflammation. You need both 3 and 6, however some people who consume too much 6 may have increased inflammation. Foods such as butter, Brazil nuts, pumpkinseeds, vegetable oils, many dressings have higher Omega-6s.
- Gluten (which you are familiar with because I believe that you said your wife has a gluten intolerance) and Casein (a protein found in dairy and wheat) may increase inflammation. 
- Processed or refined sugar and carbohydrates 
-Saturated fats
-Trans fats

Along with working with your doctor to monitor your bone density and vitamin and mineral levels, we also discussed the importance of supplementing your running with resistance training to help maintain or potentially improve your bone density. The band work that you are doing is great, however it may be advantageous to start adding some free weights to your routine. You would want to start off slow and work your way up to heavier weight (5, 8, 10 lbs) over a number of months. The weight used should be dictated by your ability to perform the exercises with proper form*, it should feel challenging for the last few repetitions but do-able, and lastly, you should not have any pain unrelated to the expected temporary gradual burn or sensation you feel during resistance training.  

The American College of Sports Medicine recommends resistance type training a minimum of 2-3 days per week targeting your major muscle groups (chest, back, core, legs) to challenge your strength using 2-4 sets of 10-15 repetitions (at a weight that feels challenging) with ~1-2 mins rest between sets. This would be a good start for someone who is already doing band training and resistance work. I would also add the gentle lateral hops, balance, and forward and backward hopping that we talked about to help maintain your bone health. Remember the goal with bone density is to maintain, and that maintenance takes doing exercises that potentially contribute to bone generation and/or maintenance, on a regular basis through your life, not just one and done. This in conjunction with the appropriate nutrient in your diet will give you the best chance at maintaining and possibly improving health."

As you are reviewing the suggestions below I would like to remind you that it is important to be sure and eat clean unprocessed foods and that you are replenishing your nutrients after your workouts.

Be sure to eat enough of the right things as per suggested below. I understand that you have lost a good bit of weight pretty fast after changing your diet, and that could be due to a number of factors including: changes in fiber, sodium, water intake and distribution, along with fat and/or potentially muscle loss.

I understand that food and fluids can be challenging because you are in a lab most of your day, but if you tend to wait as long as possible before eating, over time, your metabolism will slow which lends to increased fat storage. There is also risk of  potential muscle loss more so than if you were eating more frequently. Also, as you have experienced, you may then have a tendency to overeat when waiting so long to eat, which will also not help with weight loss.  

As far as snacks go, below are a few suggestions to get your creative snacking brain going:)

Your body uses protein to build and repair tissues, make enzymes, hormones, transport nutrients, make muscle contract, regulate water balance etc. It is important to remember that the body can use protein as an energy source, but it is not a preferred type of fuel and is used in very small amounts for this purpose.  For example, 3 ounces of lean meat provide ~30grams of protein, 8oz of milk has 8 grams and a slice of bread has 2 grams. Good sources or protein are nuts, seed, beans, low-fat dairy, meat, fish, tofu, eggs. Make sure that you have a good source of protein at each meal and snack."

During the lacrosse season, focus more on getting toward 80 grams per day. If you want to do a spot check on your calorie and protein intake, use the myfitnesspal app. 

Your body uses protein to build and repair tissues, make enzymes, hormones, transport nutrients, make muscle contract, regulate water balance etc. It is important to remember that the body can use protein as an energy source, but it is not a preferred type of fuel and is used in very small amounts for this purpose. Endurance athletes require 1.2-1.6 g / kg of body weight. For example, 3 ounces of lean meat provide ~30grams of protein, 8oz of milk has 8 grams and a slice of bread has 2 grams. Good sources or protein are nuts, seed, beans, low-fat dairy, meat, fish, tofu, eggs. Make sure that you have a good source of protein at each meal and snack."

Good sources or protein are nuts, seed, beans, low-fat dairy, meat, fish, tofu, eggs. Make sure that you have a good source of protein at each meal and snack.

Vegetarians need to be more cognizant of their protein intake. For your current weight and when you get into marathon training you need about 62 to 72 grams of protein per day. If you're not exercising you only need 52 grams per day"

If you are really interested in pursuing long term weight loss and maintenance, I'd recommend consultation with a registered dietitian.
