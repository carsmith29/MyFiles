This was apparent in your previous visit as well as this follow up. Generally, I do not get too concerned with small abnormalities in external rotation, but this alignment will place some added stress on your achilles (particularly the inside part of it). I would like you to do some hip stretches with particular attention to symmetry. In my very brief exam, I noticed you have more available external rotation passively on your right side compared to your left. Equalizing that would be a good plan."
991,Nov/16/2020,Posterior Running: Ankle & Foot,Base of Stance,Narrow,,,,"As we noted in the follow up session, you run with a slight ""cross-over"" gait pattern. This means you have a narrow base of support. This can also exacerbate the achilles stress noted above. Running with a little bit wider base would be better. Not a very wide base - just don't cross over. As we talked about, this can be done very nicely at a track or a long straight path with a prominent line. Each heel can touch the line, just don't cross over it."

Easiest way to learn a change in cadence is done by running on a treadmill will a drum beat (metronome) playing. I did a quick google search and found this youtube video of a good rate for you (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uuDPpmfEFo). You can download the audio file to your iPod and play it there.

With a very long stride, the demand on your calves (and other muscles) is greater than it should be. You can modify this and take some of the load off your calves. To do this you need to train on a treadmill. Target a cadence of 160-170 steps per minute. Use a metronome and match your foot fall to the beat. Transition VERY SLOWLY. Start with a very short distance. Take a rest day between sessions. If you tolerate it well, you can ramp up the mileage. After training for 2 weeks on the treadmill, you can transition to over ground."

This maybe due to some natural rotation (tibial torsion) in the leg.  You can see that when you sit and your knees are pointing forward.  Your hip also has more internal rotation which can also lead to the foot turning inwards.

This is sometimes just related to how people respond to the treadmill, but the result is that your knees tend to be closer to eachother than is ideal. Be sure you have at least a bit of space between your feet while running (i.e. no cross over)."

This can also be tough on your knees. I would recommend shortening your stride through a cadence increase. We recorded your cadence at 160 steps per minute. I would recommend increasing to about 172-176 steps per minute. This can be done with a metronome on a treadmill. But be sure to start with very low mileage and build up slowly.

Start with just a half mile or so. You will be loading your joints slightly differently so your body needs to adapt.

This has been linked to runners knee and may be related to your knee pain. I would suggest increasing your cadence to 170-174. This is easiest learned using a mobile metronome app on your phone. Start with very short distances and build slowly.

Just run for a short distance your first few times with the higher cadence. Run only on the treadmill with the metronome for 2 weeks.

Be sure to include resistance training to build stronger muscles and then progress to more dynamic plyometric in a controlled environment before starting your sprinting sessions.

It will take some practice but this may correct some of the bending of the knee and heavy impact to the legs.

372,Oct/29/2013,Static Assessment & Marker Placement,Illiac Crest Height/Suspected Leg Length Discrepancy,Right Leg Longer,,,"Trial Insert, Check Leg Length","As you walk and run the right side of the pelvis is higher, demonstrated by the higher R marker at the pelvis which represents the sacroiliac joint. Your scanogram from 2010 shows: The right femur measures 55.0 cm. The left femur measures 53.5  cm.  
The right tibia measures 44.0 cm. The left femur measures 43.5  
cm.  Overall, findings suggest 2.0 cm shortening of the left lower  extremity.  Adjusting the difference with the orthotics to minimize the 2 cm left leg length difference should be tried. This maybe corrected within the shoe as it is challenging getting comfortable orthotics that are thicker than 1 cm."

This can be a very problematic attribute as heavy running implies high impact loading and may predispose you to impact injuries like joint problems, and even stress fractures. But when we increased your cadence (steps per minute), this was much improved and your overstriding reduced as well. This was a very desirable adaptation and you should consider trying to maintain this in the future."

This was to a large degree improved when we removed the orthotic from your shoe. Hopefully the team at Orthotics and Prosthetics can work with your inserts to help correct this as you mechanics looked a lot better when this was corrected.
372,Oct/29/2013,Posterior Running: Pelvis & Trunk,Torso Rotation,,Decreased,Decreased,,"the stretches for the upper back, shoulders and neck can help.  Try to relax as you run through the shoulder and you can try to exaggerate the rotation as you should you be sprinting.  Just swinging the arms more loosely may get your upper body working to balance the lower body.  This is a more minor area to work on, but can reduce tenseness and make your running smoother."

371,Nov/26/2013,Other Gait,Treadmill Speed,mph,,,,"Victoria, I would like to recommend that you commit to engaging your abdominal and glut muscles while running. When you first do this it will be very taxing and you will need to slowly increase your mileage. Here is the plan we discussed:
Monday: run 2-3 minutes with your muscles engaged, then walk, repeat 3-4 times based on how fatigued your feel.
Tuesday: Strength training
Wednesday:  run 4--5 minutes with your muscles engaged, then walk, repeat 3-4 times based on how fatigued your feel.
Thursday: Strength training only
Friday:  run 5-6 minutes with your muscles engaged, then walk, repeat 3-4 times based on how fatigued your feel.
Slowly increase your endurance to run with your muscles engaged. Not at 100%, but at 20-30%, just enough to stabilize your pelvis. Back off if you start getting any new aches or pains. Email me if you have any questions: Richard.Souza@ucsf.edu."

I know your goal is to continue running for many years to come and a long stride has been linked to high impacts and various running injuries. Running with a higher cadence typically can shorten your stride length and make you more efficient. Your natural cadence was about 76-78 strides per minute (right foot hits treadmill 76 times in one minute). We had you run at 86 strides per minute and that might have been too big of a jump. I would recommend trying about 84 strides per minute. You can download the ""Mobile Metronome"" App for your phone and run with the cadence beat to keep you on track. Try 84 and try 168 (steps per minute) and see what seems to work best."

Please follow-up with your physician and someone from orthotics regarding your symptoms. I underscore the importance of reducing pain during walking prior to a continued running program. Running should be fun, so I was saddened to see that you were struggling to do something that you obviously love. 

Runsafe!

This is also known as bow-legged. This alignment has both advantages and disadvantages for runners. Many running injuries are known to be related to the opposite alignment of your (valgus) so form that perspective, it is good. However, we also know that an alignment like yours does produce very high forces on the inside of your knee cartilage so I would warn you to have a low threshold for inside knee pain and to back off if you ever develop knee swelling after a run."

Stabilizing your pelvis through strengthening and engaging your core muscles while running should help with this."

Recent research has shown that strengthening alone may improve alignment during tasks like single leg squatting (similar to the exercise you are doing with the theraband) but it does not necessarily improve knee alignment during running. For this, a form of feedback may be very beneficial. Running on a treadmill in front of a mirror can be very helpful. Using it as feedback and having your PT cue you as to good and bad alignment, getting some separation between your knees while running, has been shown to be very effective.

This may or may not be going on during your runs outdoors. But longer strides will certainly irritate your sciatica so I wasn't unhappy with your overall cadence (86) but you definitely had a few slow long strides which may contribute to your issues.

You also have a little bit of a low cadence (84). You may consider increasing your cadence ~10%. This should shorten your stride and lessen the chance that you are overstriding.
200,Jul/20/2012,Other Gait,Vertical Displacement,Normal,,,,You are an EXTREMELY efficient runner. Your vertical displacement (amount of up and down movement) while running is as small as I have seen in a long time. This is a great attribute as it implies very little wasted energy.
